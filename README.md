# RosettaGrad
---

Inspired by [Karpathy's micrograd](https://github.com/karpathy/micrograd).

Following the [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMj-3S1tku0) and writing out the engine myself, coupled with notes that I take along the way.

### Why RosettaGrad?
Cause micrograd seems like such a nice little project to be ported to other languages.
Learn DL frameworks by building them from scratch? Why not do it multiple times?

#### Roadmap
* [x] .py
* [ ] .cpp
* [ ] .cu
